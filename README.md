This repository includes solutions to the Machine Learning course assignments.

This course covered a lot of the basics of Machine Learning, starting from learning methods (supervised, unsupervised, or hybrid) and ending with implementations of milestone models (SVM, Random Forest, and other classifiers or regressors), the different algorithms, and the math behind them.

These projects contain some of these implementations: The gradient descent algorithm regarding a regression problem, A Random Forest model implementation, etc.

For more information, check these projects, or read the attached summary made by me, that contains all of the subjects of the Machine Learning course.
